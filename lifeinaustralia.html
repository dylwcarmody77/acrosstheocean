      <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-8 col-xs-8"><p>With newly arrived immigrants, it can often be a difficult task to assimilate into Australian culture. From the isles of Europe, or the heat of Asia, to the sunny beaches and patriotic culture of Australia, immigrants can struggle to feel at home.

Luckily, for my mother, this wasn’t such a problem.

“We are Anglo-Indian, so we had a lot of western customs ingrained into us. We had western foods, along with curries and that, as well as being able to speak fluent English, and didn’t look too different from those we went to school with.”

“One of the main things we didn’t really have though, was Christmas. Not too sure why, but when we arrived in Australia, I remember that Mum and Dad worked really hard to give us a great Christmas, and provide a heap of presents for us, because we never had those toys that we had in Australia.”

“It’s still a fond memory, our first Christmas. I tried to carry that tradition on throughout the years, giving back to you and Isobelle when you were little.”
