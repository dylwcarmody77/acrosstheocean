<p> The distance between Chennai and Melbourne is 8783 kilometers. By plane, it would take you about 12 to 13 hours to get from one to the other. And that is flying in 2017. </p>

<p> Indians migrating to Australia is nothing new. The 2016 census revealed that Indians are the biggest migrant group for Victoria. A mixture of better living conditions, higher standards of education and greater job opportunities are some of the reasons for immigrating to Australia. </p>

<p> For mum, those reasons weren’t too different from the 1960’s. The method to get to Australia, though, was not so similar to present times. </p>

<p>“We wanted a better life.”</p>

<p> We’re sitting in our living room, on the leather couch, which lies next to the television, precariously balanced on a table. The sunlight is shooting through our windows, warming the room around us. </p>

<p> “It was mainly your grandma’s decision. Her older sister, my Aunt Hyacinth, had come out to Australia a few years before. She pushed and pushed Mum to come over, talking about stuff like how it was a stronger country financially, how there were greater opportunities and basically a better life.” </p>

<p> “We weren’t poor,” she continued. “But we weren’t rich by any means. We were sort of had a normal financial situation in India, which wasn’t that well off, back in those days anyway. We were looking to move, and move sooner rather than later.” </p>

<p>I’m aware of the story myself. My grandfather came over in November 1968. He didn’t want to leave his family, but had to in order to set up their new lives. </p>

<p>He got a new place to live in Springvale, working as a store man in a supply store near Clayton. For six months, he slaved away, over 8000 kilometers away from his family, making a living and working towards setting up his family within Melbourne, Australia.</p>

<p>Back home, my mother and her two brothers were making plans themselves to move out to their new country. My grandma had the responsibility of looking after three children under the age of 10, all the while keeping one eye on the dream of Australia. </p>

<p>“We all lived with my Great Aunt Kitty, who was Mum’s aunt, for those six months, until it was time to go.” She told me.</p>

<p>“We didn’t think of it at the time, really. But in the 60’s, for women especially, she took three small children and basically raised us by herself for 6 months, and then made sure we got to Australia safely. And in those days, that wasn’t easy.”</p>

<p>She looked at me, and smiled.</p>

<p>“Really showed us how strong of a woman she was.”</p>
