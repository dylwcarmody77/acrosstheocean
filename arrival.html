<p>My mother and her family landed in Australia in May 1969. Making the journey on a rickety old airplane, it wasn’t the easiest for my grandma. Three little children, marveling at the sights of the world, the land they were flying over, and places that were outside their realm of imagination.</p>

<p>“There’s not a lot I can remember from the trip over.” Mum said. “I do know that it was long, though, and we got restless every now and again. Mum was good with us, she kept our minds on something as much as she could.”</p>

<p>“We landed at Essendon airport, a day or so after we left, and we were picked up by Dad.” She said, smiling.</p>

<p>“The one thing I do remember is that Dad had brought us each a block of Cadbury chocolate, and we’d never even seen chocolate before. It was surreal, and from there, we went back to our new home in Springvale, and began our new life.”</p>
